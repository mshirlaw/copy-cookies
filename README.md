### Required Permissions

- **`cookies`** - Read cookies from source domains and write to localhost
- **`activeTab`** - Work with the current tab
- **`tabs`** - Query the current tab's URL for auto-populating the domain
- **`host_permissions`** - Access cookies from any HTTP/HTTPS domain

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Domain Issues:**
- Ensure the domain is entered correctly (without http:// or https://)
- Check for typos in the domain name

**Cookie Copying Issues:**
- Some cookies might not be copyable due to browser security restrictions
- Check the browser console (F12) for detailed error messages
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions for the target domain

**Extension Not Working:**
- Verify the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Try refreshing the page and reopening the extension
- Check if the extension has the required permissions
